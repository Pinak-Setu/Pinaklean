# ğŸ”’ CodeQL Security Analysis Setup

This document describes the comprehensive security analysis setup for the Pinaklean project using CodeQL and other security scanning tools.

## Overview

The project implements automated security analysis using:
- **CodeQL** for static application security testing (SAST)
- **OSV Scanner** for dependency vulnerability detection
- **SwiftLint** for code quality and security best practices
- **GitHub Security tab** integration for vulnerability management

## CodeQL Configuration

### Query Suites Used

The analysis includes multiple CodeQL query suites:

1. **Security and Quality Queries** (`codeql/swift-queries:security-and-quality`)
   - Buffer overflows
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Path traversal attacks
   - Command injection
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Insecure random number generation

2. **Security Experimental Queries** (`codeql/swift-queries:security-experimental`)
   - Emerging security patterns
   - Experimental vulnerability detection
   - Advanced threat modeling

3. **Quality Experimental Queries** (`codeql/swift-queries:quality-experimental`)
   - Code maintainability issues
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Security-related code quality problems

### Configuration File (`.github/codeql-config.yml`)

```yaml
disable-default-queries: false

query-filters:
  - include:
      tags contain:
        - security
        - correctness
        - maintainability
        - performance

paths:
  - PinakleanApp
  - exclude:
      - PinakleanApp/.build/
      - PinakleanApp/.swiftpm/
      - "**/*.test.swift"
      - "**/Tests/**"

queries:
  - uses: codeql/swift-queries
  - uses: codeql/swift-experimental-queries

packs:
  - codeql/swift-queries:security-and-quality
  - codeql/swift-queries:security-experimental
  - codeql/swift-queries:quality-experimental
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The security analysis runs as part of the `security-tdd` job:

1. **Swift Tests** - Security-focused unit tests
2. **OSV Scanner** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
3. **CodeQL Initialization** - Setup analysis environment
4. **Swift Build** - Build application for analysis
5. **CodeQL Analysis** - Perform security analysis
6. **SARIF Upload** - Upload results to GitHub Security tab

### Dedicated Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql-security.yml`)

Additional comprehensive security analysis that runs:
- On every push to main/develop
- On pull requests
- Weekly scheduled runs (Sunday 2 AM UTC)

## Security Findings

### Accessing Results

Security findings are available in multiple locations:

1. **GitHub Security Tab**
   - Navigate to Security â†’ Code scanning alerts
   - Filter by tool: CodeQL
   - View by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low

2. **CI Artifacts**
   - Download SARIF reports from workflow runs
   - Security analysis reports in artifacts

3. **PR Comments**
   - Security findings appear as PR comments
   - Inline suggestions for fixes

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate security risk requiring urgent attention
- **High**: Significant security vulnerability
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern
- **Low**: Minor security improvement opportunity
- **Info**: Informational security suggestion

## Common Security Issues Detected

### Swift-Specific Vulnerabilities

1. **Unsafe Memory Operations**
   - Buffer overflows
   - Unchecked array access
   - Unsafe pointer operations

2. **Injection Attacks**
   - SQL injection in database operations
   - Command injection in shell operations
   - Path traversal in file operations

3. **Cryptographic Issues**
   - Weak encryption algorithms
   - Hardcoded cryptographic keys
   - Insecure random number generation

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Missing input validation
   - Improper session management
   - Weak password policies

### Code Quality Issues

1. **Resource Management**
   - Memory leaks
   - Unclosed file handles
   - Improper error handling

2. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Race conditions
   - Deadlocks
   - Improper thread synchronization

## Remediation Guidelines

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Critical/High Findings First**
   - Address critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
   - High severity within 1 week

2. **Update Dependencies**
   - Regularly update Swift packages
   - Monitor OSV database for new vulnerabilities

3. **Code Review Process**
   - All security findings require review
   - Implement fixes with tests
   - Document security decisions

### Best Practices Implementation

1. **Input Validation**
   ```swift
   // Good: Validate all inputs
   func processUserInput(_ input: String) -> String? {
       guard !input.isEmpty,
             input.count <= 100,
             !input.contains(where: { !$0.isLetter && !$0.isNumber }) else {
           return nil
       }
       return input
   }
   ```

2. **Secure Coding Patterns**
   ```swift
   // Good: Use parameterized queries
   let query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
   let statement = try db.prepareStatement(query)
   try statement.bind(1, userId)
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```swift
   // Good: Proper error handling
   do {
       try performSecurityOperation()
   } catch SecurityError.invalidInput {
       // Handle specific security errors
       logSecurityEvent("Invalid input detected")
   } catch {
       // Handle generic errors securely
       logSecurityEvent("Security operation failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
   }
   ```
