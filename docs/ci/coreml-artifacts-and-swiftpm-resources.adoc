= CoreML compiled artifacts and SwiftPM resources
:doctype: article

This document describes our policy for CoreML compiled artifacts and the SwiftPM resources configuration that keeps CI stable and diffs small.

== Rationale

Compiled CoreML bundles (`.mlmodelc`) include generated `Info.plist` files that can change across Xcode/macOS versions. Committing these compiled artifacts causes constant diffs and CI churn.

== Policy

- Do not commit compiled `.mlmodelc/Contents/Info.plist` files
- Keep source `.mlmodel` files under `Core/Resources/Models/`
- Limit resource processing to the models directory

== SwiftPM configuration

The target resource list is narrowed to only process ML model resources:

[source,swift]
----
resources: [
    .process("Resources/Models")
]
----

This mirrors the change in `PinakleanApp/Package.swift` and avoids bundling transient artifacts.

== Impact

- Smaller, cleaner diffs
- More stable CI runs across environments
- No loss of functionality at runtime

== Migration checklist

- Remove previously committed compiled `Info.plist` files under `*/Models/*`
- Ensure source `.mlmodel` files remain in `Resources/Models`
- Verify build: `swift build && swift test`
