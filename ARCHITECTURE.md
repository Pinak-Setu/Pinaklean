```swift
class DataManager {
    // Fast in-memory cache for session data
    private let cache = NSCache<NSString, CleanableItem>()
    
    // SQLite for the persistent file index (via GRDB)
    private let database: DatabaseQueue
    
    // Core Data for storing complex object graphs (e.g., user models)
    private let coreDataStack: CoreDataStack
    
    // CloudKit for syncing settings and metadata across devices
    private let cloudContainer: CKContainer
}
```
